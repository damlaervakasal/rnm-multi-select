# Rick and Morty Character Multi-Select

This project is a React Native application that fetches character data from an API, allowing users to search and select characters. The app enables users to search for characters with a dynamic search input, make selections via checkboxes, and view highlighted text in search results. The data is fetched from the API through a custom hook, and the app features a responsive design that works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
