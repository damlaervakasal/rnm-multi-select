# Rick and Morty Character Multi-Select

This project is a React Native application built with Expo, which simplifies the development process and streamlines deployment. It fetches character data from an API, allowing users to search and select characters. The app enables users to search for characters with a dynamic input field, make selections via checkboxes, and view highlighted text in the search results. The data is fetched from the API through a custom hook, and the app features a responsive design that works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
